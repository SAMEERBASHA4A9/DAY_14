Blocking and non-blocking assignments are crucial concepts in Verilog. They determine how simulation events are executed and how data flows in your design. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. Blocking Assignments (=):
Definition: A blocking assignment executes sequentially. The next statement does not execute until the current statement is completed.
Syntax: variable = expression;
Execution: Executes in the order written in the code.
Common Use: Typically used in combinational logic or testbench stimulus generation.
Key Features:
Statements block the execution of subsequent statements until completed.
Used inside initial and always blocks.
Example:
verilog
Copy
Edit
initial begin
  a = 1;  // Assign 1 to 'a'
  b = a + 1;  // Assign 'a+1' to 'b'
end
Execution Order:
a is assigned 1.
Then b is assigned the value of a + 1, which is 2.
Behavior:
Sequential Execution: The simulator completes a = 1 before proceeding to b = a + 1.
2. Non-Blocking Assignments (<=):
Definition: A non-blocking assignment allows statements to execute in parallel without waiting for the previous one to complete.
Syntax: variable <= expression;
Execution: The right-hand side is evaluated immediately, but the assignment happens at the end of the current time step.
Common Use: Typically used in sequential logic or clocked processes.
Key Features:
Enables concurrent updates.
Avoids race conditions in sequential logic.
Example:
verilog
Copy
Edit
always @(posedge clk) begin
  a <= 1;  // Schedule 'a' to be updated to 1
  b <= a + 1;  // Schedule 'b' to be updated to 'a+1'
end
Execution Order:
At the rising edge of the clock, a <= 1 and b <= a + 1 are evaluated.
Assignments to a and b happen at the end of the time step.
This ensures the old value of a is used for the b computation.
Behavior:
Parallel Execution: Both assignments occur concurrently, but the order of execution does not affect the final result.
Comparison of Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments:
Feature	                     Blocking (=)	             Non-Blocking (<=)
Execution Order	             Sequential	               Concurrent
Usage	                       Combinational logic	     Sequential logic
Dependency	                 One statement depends     Statements evaluated in parallel
                             on the previous	
Timing of Assignment	       Immediate	               At the end of the current time step
Risk of Race Conditions	     High	                     Reduced

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
Mixing Blocking and Non-Blocking Assignments in Sequential Logic:

Leads to simulation mismatches or unintended behavior.
Example (Incorrect):
verilog
Copy
Edit
always @(posedge clk) begin
  a = 1;  // Blocking
  b <= a; // Non-blocking
end
The order of updates becomes ambiguous.
Using Blocking Assignments in Sequential Logic:

Can lead to race conditions.
Quick Tips:
Use blocking (=) for combinational logic:
verilog
Copy
Edit
always @(*) begin
  y = a & b;  // Combinational operation
end
Use non-blocking (<=) for sequential logic:
verilog
Copy
Edit
always @(posedge clk) begin
  a <= d;  // Sequential operation
end
